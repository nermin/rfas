Setup
-----
* 0MQ must be installed on all nodes (client and worker)
* LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be defined and point to 0MQ libraries directory (ex.: /usr/local/lib)
* All worker nodes must have client JAR file in the classpath (due to lack ot remote class loading)

Roadmap
-------
1. Remote class loading on the worker side
2. Potentially replace synchronization/concurrent hashmap/blocking queue with Actors
3. Define a common project on which ventsink and worker shall depend
4. Incorporate some kind of logging (ex. SLF4S, Configgy, etc...)
